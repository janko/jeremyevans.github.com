<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">This is mainly due to Sequel's superior connection pool design.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Sequel was designed to use a connection pool from the very beginning.  It doesn't checkout a connection from the pool until it is needed, and returns it as soon as it is not needed.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">ActiveRecord checks out a connection when it is needed, but you need to check the connection in manually, it doesn't do so automatically.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Sequel is safe to use in any threaded code, whereas ActiveRecord requires you to handle the connection pool checkins manually if used in threaded code.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">However, what if you want to get all artists that appear on albums that this artist appears on.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">That requires three join tables.  You need to go through the albums_artists join table, use the artists table as a join table, and then go through the albums_artists join table again in the other direction.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The many_through_many plugin allows you to write a small amount of code to create associations that would be very difficult to create with ActiveRecord, and impossible to eagerly load.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">With this plugin, you can eagerly load the related artists for a group of artists, and at the same time you can also eagerly load the albums for all related artists.</p>

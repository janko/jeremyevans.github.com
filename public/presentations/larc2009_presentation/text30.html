<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Do you feel depressed when you file a bug report with one of the other guys, and it just sits, festering and rotting on their bug tracker, as if they have a more is better approach about everything?</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">How would you feel if you took your car to the repair shop and told them exactly what was wrong, and they told you to find three other people having your problem before they would even consider fixing it?</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Wouldn't you rather get a response quickly from someone who probably knows how to fix it, and may even fix it for you?</p>

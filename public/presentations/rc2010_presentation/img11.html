<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p><p style="direction:ltr;">Support for DateTimes was not added until ruby 1.8.0.  In ruby 1.8.0, the Date and DateTime classes were pretty much the same.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">In order to handle fractional days, the date was now stored as a rational, and included a time zone offset, even though dates themselves don't have fractional components or specific timezones.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Basically, in ruby 1.8 and 1.9, Date objects don't really represent dates, they represent DateTimes, usually at midnight in UTC.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">The 1.8.0 version of Date was about 3 times slower than the 1.6.0 version, and 4 times slower than the 1.0 version.</p>

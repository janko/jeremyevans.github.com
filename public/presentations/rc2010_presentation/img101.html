<h3>Notes:</h3><br>

<p><p style="direction:ltr;">Each modifier character has its own branch in the switch statement.  Almost all cases are handled by a construction like this, where sprintf is used to append characters to the returned string.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">For those of you familiar with C, this may look slightly unsafe taken in isolation.  However, home_run ensures there are at least 64 characters available in the returned string buffer before all of the sprintf calls, and none of them should produce more than 64 characters of output.</p>

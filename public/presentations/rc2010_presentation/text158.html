<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">I next attempted to port home_run to rubinius.  Because rubinius did not fully support all of the C API features I was using, I had to submit bugs and patches to the rubinius project to add support for the features I was using, which were also applied quickly.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Rubinius became the second ruby implementation to pass all of home_run's specs.</p>

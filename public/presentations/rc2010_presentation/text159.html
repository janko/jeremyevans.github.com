<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Finally, I attempted to get home_run working with Jruby's C extension support.  This was back in early August before the C extension support was finished and merged into the jruby master branch.</p>
<p style="direction:ltr;"></p>
<p style="direction:ltr;">Like with rubinius, I had to add some extension methods that were not yet implemented, but my patch was applied quickly and Jruby became the third ruby implementation to support home_run.</p>

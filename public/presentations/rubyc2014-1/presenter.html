<p>Let us consider a database that stores blog posts in one table, and replies to those blog posts in a separate table. Here is a basic Sequel model for the posts table.</p>

<p>If you want to add a method that returns all replies for a post, a simple solution is something like this. This adds an instance method named replies that returns all replies where the post_id for the reply matches the id of the current post.|This is simple and straight forward. However, since methods like this are very common, it makes sense to abstract them and offer a higher level interface.</p>

<p>With Sequel, the rule should be followed for limited associations. If you are eagerly loading the first 10 replies for a set of posts, calling the first_10_replies method on any of the returned posts will return an array containing the first 10 replies, even if the post has 1000 replies.</p>

<p>The simplest way to fix it is to just not eager load in that case. Basically, if asked to eager load for an association with a limit, just do not eager load. When the first_10_replies method is called for each post, issue a query to get the first 10 replies for that post.</p>

<p>Another simple way to handle eagerly loading the first 10 replies association is to eagerly load all associated replies, but take the resulting array of replies for each post, and use array slicing to extract the first 10 replies before returning the results to the user.</p>

<p>This was Sequel&#x2019;s original strategy for eager loading limited associations. What Sequel does is fairly simple, just using a range to slice the array to return only the first 10 repiles.|At the database level, this does not perform any differently than the ActiveRecord approach of loading all objects, and in many cases it performs worse than skipping the eager load, but at least it ensures that the user gets correct results and the rule is not violated.</p>

<p>One strategy that uses a single SQL query to eagerly load limited associations is to use a correlated subquery. A correlated subquery is when a subquery references columns from the query that contains it, and for each row returned by the outer query, the subquery is evaluated separately.</p>

<p>This highlighted part shows the correlation. The subquery&#x2019;s WHERE clause filters for rows where the replies in the subquery have the same post id as replies in the outer query.

<p>Note that it is possible for the query to be optimized such that this subquery is only run 5 times. A good correlated subquery optimizer will realize that only expression in the subquery that references the outer query is the highlighted replies.post_id. Since this is the only expression in the correlated subquery that varies based on the current row in the outer query, you can cache the results of previous subquery evaluations by the post_id and only reevaluate the subquery if you see a post_id that is not in the cache.|This is one area where Microsoft SQL Server&#x2019;s optimizer is significantly better than PostgreSQL&#x2019;s optimizer. On Microsoft SQL Server, using a correlated subquery for eager loading can be faster than the default of slicing the array, but in PostgreSQL it can be orders of magnitude slower.</p>

<p>There is actually a fairly simple way to do so. You can use a UNION to combine the results of each of queries you would use when regularly loading. The UNION strategy requires a significantly different approach than the other methods previously discussed. Instead of starting with the query for an unlimited association and adding a filter to remove rows that are over the limit, you just UNION separate regular association queries.</p>

<p>How does a UNION query avoid the unnecessary processing required by the other strategies? It is because for each subquery in the union query, it can use a single index, read only the number of index entries specified by association limit, fetch only those rows from the table, and move on to the next subquery. This avoids processing rows beyond the limit for the association, which is why it is the fastest strategy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are some problems with the UNION strategy. On PostgreSQL, somewhere between eagerly loading replies for 5,000 posts and 10,000 posts, you start hitting the default stack limit of 2MB. You can increase PostgreSQL&#x2019;s stack limit up to 32MB, but at some point you will hit the stack limit and the query will fail. The UNION approach also takes up significantly more memory than the window function approach, so it is more likely to hit a memory limit as well.</p>

<p>The good news is these limits are easy to work around. Instead of sending a single union query with 10,000 subqueries, you can send 10 union queries each with 1,000 subqueries, or 100 union queries each with 100 subqueries.</p>

<p>In my testing on PostgreSQL, I found that sending a single UNION query with 1000 subqueries was signficantly slower than sending 10 UNION queries each with 100 subqueries, which surprised me. It turns out that a UNION query with 200 subqueries is more than 2 times slower than a UNION query with 100 subqueries.| However, if you decrease the number of subqueries per UNION query, you increase the total number of queries you need to send to the database.|What I have found is that on PostgreSQL, the optimum number of subqueries per UNION query is actually a function of the latency between the database and the application.</p>

<p>First, in case you are unfamiliar with this concept, both Sequel and ActiveRecord support filtering by many-to-one associations. For a many-to-one association, this is basically sugar for using objects instead of their foreign keys when filtering.</p>

<p>Sequel goes a step farther than ActiveRecord, allowing filtering by all types of associations. So this code allows you to select all posts that have that reply. Since this is a one-to-many association and not a many-to-many association, this should return the single post associated with the reply.|Note that while ActiveRecord appears to support this syntax, it will generate incorrect SQL, in the worst case resulting in silent failure.</p>

<p>Now consider the case where the association you are filtering by has a limit. In this case, using the same query is incorrect. This reply might be the hundredth reply to that post, in which case it is not one of the first 10 replies, and therefore the query should not return any posts.</p>

<p>Unlike when eager loading, there is no way to slice an array to fix the problem.

In the filtering by associations cases, it returns an array of posts, so you cannot use the association limit. You must handle the issue purely at the SQL level to get correct results.</p>

<p>Here is the SQL for the window function strategy. This is basically the same SQL as used in the correlated subquery strategy, except for the inner subquery. Instead of using a correlated subquery, it uses a window function, and just as before, since you cannot filter directly on the window function, it has to run the window function in a subquery and filter that in an outer query. So instead of 2 nested subqueries it uses 3 nested subqueries.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not all roses with the window function approach. Especially in the case where you are only looking for the posts using a single reply, the correlated subquery approach can be much faster. However, the window function approach is more consistent, dealing better with larger datasets. At least, that is true on PostgreSQL.</p>
